Wiring Instructions:
 * Arduino analog pin A8 should connect to joystick 1 VRy
 * Arduino analog pin A9 should connect to joystick 1  VRx
 * Arduino analog pin A10 should connect to joystick 2 VRy
 * Arduino analog pin A11 should connect to joystick 2  VRx

 * Connect the TFT display to the Arduino
 * Arduino digital pin 53 should connect to Button 1
 * Arduino digital pin 43 should connect to Button 2
 * The other side of both buttons should be connected to ground, since these are PULL_UP buttons in our code
 * Connect the +5V and Ground on both the joystick to the +5V and Ground on the Arduino
 * The joystick SW does not need to be connected on either joystick
